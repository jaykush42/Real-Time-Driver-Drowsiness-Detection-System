# **Real-Time Driver Drowsiness Detection System**

## Overview
The Real-Time Driver Drowsiness Detection System is an innovative software application designed to enhance road safety by monitoring a driver's alertness in real-time and alerting them when signs of drowsiness are detected. This system uses computer vision techniques to analyze a driver's facial features and movements to determine their level of attentiveness. It can be integrated into vehicles, particularly in-vehicle infotainment systems or advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), to provide real-time alerts to the driver, helping prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving.

## Features
**Real-Time Monitoring:** The system continuously monitors the driver's face and eye movements in real-time to detect signs of drowsiness.

**Facial Recognition:** It utilizes facial recognition technology to identify the driver's face and track facial features.

**Eye Tracking:** The system tracks the driver's eye movements, including blinking rate and duration, to assess their level of alertness.

**Yawning Detection:** Yawning is a clear indicator of drowsiness, and the system can identify and track yawning episodes.

**Alert System:** When drowsiness is detected, the system activates an alert mechanism to wake up the driver, such as visual and auditory alerts or haptic feedback.
